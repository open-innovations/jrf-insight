Identity - OK for now - but may rethink for "less JRF" later

Thematic - old school JRF, need to update - see email

Start to think about streamlined infographics - also interative, clickable, programmatic

Also
Care, Economic Insecurity

Infographics - 1 in 5; 2 in 10; etc.
More user-friendly, easy way to communicate information
More relevant, more easy to interpret
More visually "poppy"
A visual reference of the geographic area

Scope to do overall picture for northern regions - click on a map to go into regions, LAs, neighbourhood areas
Really straight forward navigating directly from the landing page
"I'm really interested in ..." children, Calderdale

Imagine yourself as a front-line worker - I have 10 minutes to get that information - couple of clicks and you're there

Getting a view of those personas is important

Colours and themes - visual impairment - visual vs tabular arrangements of data

Audit for accessibility - need to do more for these things

Thanks Luke, think there might be some things in terms of data standards - i.e. mention source, rounding, after or before housing costs etc, but understand this is just an example for now

Triangulation of data - greater value than just seeing data
Value in time-series

Rosario and Adel - Homeless Link - excited - already thinking about whether they have data for sharing and publishing
Triangluation - cumulative impact on local population

First navigation - insights - list of mini-case studies; scenarios; 
One short sentence - what is they multi-deimensinsla aspect so poverty, socio-economic injustuce, mental health an dwellbeing, physcial health, n York, other regions, etc.
 Place-based? Overall cumulative impact of these factors?
Triangulation of different scenarios, aggregate of these are in place in ...

Christian, sounds good on playground. Â interaction between data and also how we split within a single dataset at same time too is a question from me

Also think about families who might be at risk - to what extent to we look above thresholds of poverty - capture at risk; 
Yong people leaving care system - risk at many things, not just pvoerty
Structure - bottom 10%, managing, at risk, who might 

How to split different parts of the population - take care with definitional structures for datasets

Send over pre-canned JRF definitions and useful categories - Peter will send through a crib-sheet

More human definitions of categories?

Download data and save images, social sharing links, etc

Would be nice to have link to orig source too where there is an obvious one - i.e. so folk can get to ONS inflation report from CPI page


Do we look through geography, topic, type of poverty

Longer term aim - poverty gets too compartmentalised - different manifestations of poverty are all poverty.

Housing, health, fuel - all linked - how do we bring things together


Triangulation, combination of data, we might create a culture where you have the cumulative picture, then you can remove layers

Plug in different dimensions
Health - public health England - dashbaords links to 
Well-being - isolation and loneliness - national dataset
Not just survey data; 


Focus on households - households rather than individuals
