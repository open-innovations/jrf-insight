# Principles for presenting numbers

The [Accessible Numbers](https://accessiblenumbers.com/) site contains useful
guidance on presenting numbers for people who [suffer with maths anxiety, have
low numeracy or experience dyscalculia].
While the focus is on designing services which are as accessible as they can be,
the guidance is useful for the kind of data presentation site that is being
envisioned for the North England Insight Finder.

This brief document is an attempt to codify some of the more relevant guidance
into a style guide for presentation of numbers.

The basic guidance, as stated in on the
[About dyscalculia, low numeracy and maths anxiety page](
  https://accessiblenumbers.com/about-dyscalculia-low-numeracy-and-maths-anxiety
),
as relevant to presenting data, is as follows

* remove unnecessary numbers and get rid of decimal places unless it’s money

* leave lots of space so that numbers don’t jump around so much on the screen
  for people with Irlen syndrome 

* explain what numbers mean and add context about why the numbers matter

There is other guidance presented related to pre-filling information, not
requiring people to remember reference numbers and including people who
struggle with numbers in the design process. These are worth bearing in mind,
but are more relevant so building interactive services.

## What numbers to present

The guidance on the Accessible Numbers site is related covered by the
[Round up numbers and remove unnecessary content page](
  https://accessiblenumbers.com/round-up-numbers
). This deals with the mental cost of attention.

For large numbers, it's more appropriate to use words (so 120 million is better than 120,000,000).

If you do need to present a large number, make sure it has commas separating the groups of thousands.

For most headline numbers that we present, rounding to the nearest couple of
significant figures is appropriate. 120 million is quite as good as 123 million for most purposes.

Avoid decimals, unless these are significant or you need to show a really specific monetary value. Bear in mind that 10.0 million and 100 million could also be confused. Never use formulations like '0.xx million'.

Make sure the typeface you use clearly distinguished between 0 and O or 8 for all sizes of type presented. 1, l and I are also potentially confusable.

It's generally better for headline / general usage figures to be opresented in the form 1 in 7, rather than 14.3%.

## How to present numbers

The guidance on Accessible Numbers is contained on the 
[Leave space around numbers page](
https://accessiblenumbers.com/leave-space-around-numbers
).

When presenting a key finding, ensure that it can pe understood as easily as
possible. For headlines, this might mean presending the data with clear
white-space around to help people focus on the numbers.

This also helps people who are trying to get a rapid sense of the scale of an
finding. Presenting summary or headline numbers 'above the fold' and in their
own context, with accessible colour contrasts.

Avoid stark colour contrasts (black on white or vice versa) as this can cause
text to be less easy to read for those with condidions such as Irlen's syndrome.

## How to explain numbers

The Accessible Number site contains guidance on the
[Explain what numbers mean page](
  https://accessiblenumbers.com/explain-what-numbers-mean
).

Charts should have a text alternative to describe both what is being showed and
any conclusions.

Visualisations should not be overlaid with source information, titles or
legends. These should be nearby, but not interfering with the charts.

Charts should not rely solely on colour to differentiate between content, but
should also contain pattern or shape.

Use a colour-blindness simulator to check the effect that colours have.

Any figures, particularly those outlining conclusions, should have a clear and
unambiguous description of what they mean. This is especially true if
presenting something potentially confusing such as probabilities ('30% chance of
rain') or change in a value from a previous value ('20% growth on last reported figure').
