Consider the North as the baseline (denominator, etc)
Thinking about the future, baseline will chagne if we remove the "North" filter
However, we should also be able to place the North within the context of the wider UK, so we may need some UK-wide (perhaps just England?) data in there to be able to make these comparisons

Comparisons to "statistically similar areas" should include non-North geographies, even if they're not included in the tool
Cf ONS Local Authority interactive tool

Build from hyper-local areas


Also a role in showing how to combine different datasets, particularly when dealing with devolved nations data which may be a different methodology (or NA)

Think that even, at a UK-wide level, we should probably consider the four nations as the "base denominator"

For Stuart and OI Lume charts - include a 

ONS urban/rural distinction

Population estimates
Population density
Hourly wage
Household income - and primary/secondary income and sources

Health - start simple - maybe break out later?
PHE - fingerprints - single indicator?
QALY
IMD - breakdown into health, quality, old people, children, etc.

Make front page about number of people
Income at a household level rather than individual?
Household average size

Overcrowding as an urban issue
Deprived areas 

Housing 
PRS vs social
interaction of overcrowding, price by n bedrooms, and housing benefit caps

Urban rural - percentage of people who live in an urban/rural area

Identification of different types of geography on the maps (particualry pertinent at region level)

Health - PHE Fingertips
ONS morbidity data - frequently updated? - better than IMD - long-term conditions

Mental health - loneliness and social isolation - 

Pension credit - statistics as a overall higher guide to

Deviation of wage from living wage
Proportion of population above/below living wage
