[ ] Home page needs a link to more detailed about page/intro blog/strategy, etc
[ ] JRF to send updates for wording, etc.
[ ] Rename spotlight pages to include word "spotlight" to improve clarity of search results
[ ] Put video tutorials at bottom of home page. Link to about us, feedback, etc. in footer (maybe about us in the main menu as well?)
[ ] JRF to put together some copy for us to copy to paste into the site
[ ] Need to make place index more manageable - maybe via a map? cross-highlighting from list to map
[ ] Add backgrounds to maps to help people locate places
[ ] Think we need higher resolution geojson files for smaller places
[ ] Metadata improvements - filenames, descriptions - where should you be taken if you click on something? We need to abstract the complexity of the data away and direct people to what's in them. Is this what the topic tagging style thing should do? Maybe we restructure data to be able to see "across" datasets and what's in them? Where did it come from? Links to pipelines with the code
[ ] Need to add advice/guidance on how to download data
[ ] Add navigation to move to a different spotlight for the same area


## Infographics
- big number with some contextual information
- does Rosario mean graphics/icons for infographics or just summaries?
  - two basic types: people icons and households - measures that people can relate to
  - caution about denominators on simplified ratios
  - generally like the waffle charts
Issues around things like unemployment which, out of ten, will always approximate to "less than 1 in 10" for all areas - makes it non-comparable

Site should go straight to big numbers, dive deeper for the charts and detail

## Spotlights
- not tell what you'll find, but how you can navigate
- think about the vertical/horizontal navigation story
- direct people to how they can navigate the content
- Perhaps a dashboard of spotlights - including descriptions
- perhaps summary statistic(s) for each spotlight
- maybe latest data highlighted, but make it clear that time-series data is available within the site
- include the datasets that have been used in creating this spotlight

## Spotlights data inclusion
- originally 8/9, have thinned down to 3 that can be well populated
- option to include placeholders for others, but we need to be clear
- do we stick with spotlights for estimates, we just focus on spotlights for which we have estimates, or whether there is room to have estimates alongside demographic estimates
- generally a less is more approach?
- Information to be presented first as infographics, with tables/charts etc lower down
- So what does all this mean? Where and when does this go? - prob phase 2
- top infographics should be "worst three"


### Economic insecurity
- IMD at levels above LAD - follow same approach as MSOA-LAD - or just kill it? Or provide x% of population living in most deprived x% of areas - re-weight for ward population
- Overall population, of which, in poverty, claiming benefits, universal credit
- travel distance to work
- rented/owned
- overcrowding
- LHA rates/availability
- minimum income standards
- something about average wages in an area
- lone parents with kids/large families and CB cap
- ethnicity breakdown
- age distribution?
- fuel poverty
- child poverty
- savings
- debt
- generally, vulnerability
- gender breakdown
- gender pay gap
- % jobs paid less than the living wage
- reasons for economic inactivity
- caring, formal and informal
- How many of these do we want?
- Data could do with showing both absolute and relative positions
  - [11:48] AdÃ©l Schofield: but we have to be careful around ranking not propping up existing stigma for certain places - we talked about showing averages on Monday

## Latest data updated on:
- careful about not suggesting that all data has been updated
- instead that the insight finder was last updated on _x_
- site may be updated without the data being updated
- Maybe "data on this site is automatically updated when new data released"
- "Site update on _x_, last new data was added on _y_"
- "Data refreshed on _x_"

### Adel:
There is the "shedding light on a poverty-related topic" blurb beneath the spotlights. Personally I'd click on it if I didn't know exactly what it was, cos I'm curious. I think we're getting into user testing fodder now. I like the idea of maybe for now pulling in one key stat from each spotlight

Write about the spotlights, and link through to them or their content from within the site

Video examples of "how to use"
- "What am I supposed to do?", "what can I do?"
- See EV calculator as an example

You can:
- navigate places
- investigate spotlights
- look at the raw data
- search

## About page
Can contain:
- infrastructure
- OI
- what JRF is trying to achieve
- links to interesting websites, blogs, etc.

## Order of primary nav menu
Places, Spotlights, Data, Search, About ->
Spotlights, Places, Data, About, Search (including icon and maybe textInput?)

## Providing estimates
- including information on how we do the modelled estimates

## Data page
- nervousness about distribution/summary data information, but field lists are useful

## Question for the wider group
Do you understand why it is and what it's trying to do
Spotlights
Roughly understand hwo to move around
What you're being presented with
What would you like to see about this
