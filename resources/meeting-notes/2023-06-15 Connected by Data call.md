question first approach - came through all engagements
who gets to define the question
we don't know what question to ask to start

added layer - who gets to define the question = grassroots poverty groups
challnegs of lived experience - data always answering someone else's question, top down, not from the community
How can tools and platforms be oriented to surface those questions?
Answering the question may be a research job, not just data visualisation
Caputirng nad reflecting back the unanswerable questions
Few sketches of tools
More or less a local insight finder
As you zoom into an area, can it be our question
Relative level of deprivation -> we know what our area's like - what resources are available to us?
Not just relative to other areas, but a list of things
Can we build things to get to these user-led questions

Very different audiences - organisation data
Vast numbers of organisations working on various themes
Which group is it targating? Grass roots, knowledge providers, infrastructure organisations, what scale are they working at, what are they focusing on?

How platforms can broker connections between these organisations
Example - civil study orgs holding data, mid-levle practioners holding questiosn, researchers holding a desire to to do research, but doesn't know on what - can we join these up?
Go beyond what does the data immediately tell us, into what questions are needed to be asked and answered

Layers of different stakehodlers engage as users of the platform, members of the insight initiative

Popele don't "pull" information - instead through pushes. People don't sit around looking for information

Push scenarios - newsletter, local meetings, better collaborative meetings - what does the data tell us about this place, theme, etc?
Meetings dropping off post-pandemic? Seem to be missed by people
Have conversations more thematically

Can we build an on-line community?

When people get ot "where do I go next", the data often doesn't signpost you. Who else knows about it and might collaborate/help

Governance - people affected by a product, insight, etc., are involved in the process and delivery

And product which integrates, there should be a product-level governance group
Giving that group some veto power, go or no-go calls on the product and its development. Becomes a check and balance, not just an advisory group

Story example - grassroots poverty action group - labelling - risks in using "deprived" labels 
same with places being represented as wealthier than they are because of boundaries

Organisational scale - what this means for how they use the site
National orgs, regional, hyper-local
Some have a research team
Practioners may refer to their internal research team
If small, or delivery-focused, you're trying to do this yourself

How to we engage with the more research-focused teams to help supply answers, existing research?



Delineation
Test some of these concerns and questions raised by the ecosystem
Looking at local level - not just on deficit - assets, people, places and communities
Target users - primarily charities and foundations (communities) working in that area, profile, resources available
Try to add commissioned data
May be early days to incorporate some of this stuff


Open referral? -investigate
Showing what's missing - we know these big organisations are her, but we dont' know about smaller ones
Known unknowns, unknown unknowns

Community of interest as a key way of categorising

With some communities (grassroots), front-line, had interesting geographies
- collections of polygons
- ten most deprived communites in Surrey - place may not be contiguous
- BME communities in Bristol - set of community centres - only interested in these places

Think about delivery/marketing model of the platform
Will they come via front page, through external links to specific pages
e.g. GM poverty action network
Being used in Zoom calls where people get together to discuss issues in their area
What are the journeys/pathways within the sight

Help them find/discover the questions
Is this the role of the spotlight

Who are the organisations that are happy to field user questions?
"Ask us helpdesk"
Work with ODI on data portals - investigate

Not just technical/data support, but also helping them/thinking about what the question is?

From economic insecurity - what are the theme names? Emotions, physical, hoo to we identify

"Movement first"
Lots of organisations don't use/need data - work on hunches
Values people sign up to, commitment, builds demand and commitment to share data
Org-level, be part of an insight infrastructure, get the data shared
Also individual level, part of a wider movement

What about user interactivity - sign-ups for more info, newsletter, etc.?

Decision - infrastructure - need to become a shared movement
Those that are pushing for more use of isnight and evidence
Potential to create a shared movement around a product
Insight Finder, a thematic area, tow dimensions - geography and economic insecurity
Can we start to galvanise a movement around these areas

How do we surface known problems that aren't visible in the data?
Identify additional, newly known gaps
Identify blockers - gaps in data and evidence from local knowledge
