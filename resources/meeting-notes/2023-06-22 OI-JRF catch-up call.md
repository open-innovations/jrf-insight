2023-06-22 OI-JRF catch-up call

Clarification of scope
Geography and spotlight as two principal "routes", focuses, etc.

Hyper-local - ability to integrate data from particular small-geography projects into the infrastructure

Thinking ahead, a project with data for action
Charity data - can we turn it into an asset

Easiest way to link these datasets will be by place

If place approach works, we can integrate data
Demand, service provision, socio-demographic information on the people they interact with

Loose infrastructure to aggregate and bring together disparate data sources from OI and Stuart's work on data mapper

Geography concepts

Ability to "skip" a level or levels in the geography navigation

Similar assisted navigation not just on spotlights (user questions, I want to see data about income", also for geography "Show me data on Leeds"

IDea is to rpovdie information in at least a couple of formats
Still keen on infographics (perhaps more contextual for for spotlights rather than geographies)
Not everyone likes maps

Easy and straightforward data as key starting point for place - latest census data on population, etc. Aggregate IMD, HBAI

Number of people/household units

Children in poverty as a good dataset - LSOA level - numbers, not just households

Back to concept of infographics for place
Overall population
2 in 6 children in poverty

Activities performed by charities in the area
Who else does your thing?

Need to ID interesting analyses for each spotlight, area
What types = headline statistics, man, min, mean, median, time series

Ability to compare places under themes? - definitely a nice to have at this stage

Places, spotlights, themes, compare (places)
People can compare, but within pre-defined things. "Statistical neighbours"

Giles to share example of Covid vaccine update and ethnicity - two maps or charts side-by-side

Local needs data bank - what Rosario had in mind for compare areas function

Q: relative or absolute 
Children in poverty after housing costs

HBAI - do lean on Peter for help on variables

Infographics could be used in the compariosn
What info helps charities to compare their areas for funding bids?

e.g. 1 in 2 vs 1 in 6 across places

Imagine like product comparisons on websites

Simplicity of infographics - population density, prevalance of Covid 
Density, frequency, occurency as a simple and powerful comparison tool
What does the 1 in 5 mean in terms of density, frequency, occurency

Health, access to opportunity
Transport accessibility - can't get to anything 

Charity density per 1000 people
Prevalence as a common illuminator across different domains

4-B is the dataset for endchildpoverty.org

Question for Peter - what headline statistics should we be using from the UK Poverty report as key numbers for intro to site

Start the discussion about modelled data for small areas before summer, but most delivery will be later in the process

Highlight missing data and geographies to provide a list for modelling
