# Notes
### General layout of the page:
Showing JRF the site. Explaining layout. Infographics are key "at a glance" view of that spotlight.
Model is aggregation of key metrics.
Key indicators is view across place for individual metrics.
Demographic breakdown is for individual groups.

General comments:
Note for HBAI: poverty rate for the group rather than poverty rate for population(e.g.) percent of white people that are in low income hou seholds as a percentage of total white people (not total population)
- want to compare (e.g. unemployment) to average for the north / UK as a benchmark. (ideally for all stats). 

# Qs
Does the layout make sense? The navigation?
What data do we want to see ? how should it be sliced up?
What could we do that is new? How to make it actionable?
What would be the key infographics?
What would be the key measures for housing model?
WHat would be key indicators (time-series and geo)? 


# Longlist dataset suggestions
### Relativity: 
- how it compares to other areas and to itself in the past
- ideal to have UK wide comparisons
- Numbers living in temporary accommodation 
- Numbers on social housing waiting lists 
- Current and historic tenure mix - drawing on census data
- Social housing sales - RTB
- completions of new homes relative to existing stock 
- House prices across the distribution of prices 
- SRS rent levels and rent increase 
- PRS rent levels and rental growth 
- Both BHC and AHC poverty rates - bigger the gap between the two, the larger the implied effect of housing costs in poverty rates 
- Rates of overcrowding

# General points
- regultor for housing: calculate social housing at local authority
private (ons) lower upper quartile, mean rent 

- Ratio of LQ rent to LQ earnings over time (per geo). - affordibility indicator. (always benchmarked against england). 

- social and private (srs prs) how its increased over time. 

- rightmove and zoopla (web scraping rent prices). Is that data open - 
think it's publicly available. (quarterly reports). (consider seasonal trends too)

- short lets / holiday homes (e.g. airbnb): https://hub.rightmove.co.uk/rental-price-tracker/

- no. social housing waiting list (people per 1000)
- temp accom(per 1000)

- current/historic tenure mix. ons (dwellings estimates)

- home completions (private and public as well as social housing sales)

- temp accom: https://england.shelter.org.uk/professional_resources/policy_and_research/policy_library/still_living_in_limbo

- statxplore Housing benefit (in payment) as proportion of households.

- Affordability ratios: Rents to earnings ratios, House price to earnings ratios
