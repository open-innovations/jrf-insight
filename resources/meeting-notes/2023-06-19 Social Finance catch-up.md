2023-06-19 Social Finance catch-up

Quite a lot of pipeline-based work in OI
Extending from existing EDD work
Producing new slice-diced versions that will drive visualisation for various contexts
Static-site based on Lume, dvc, etc.

Geographies, themes, domains, spotlights

Need to at least highlight where data is relevant, e.g. at geographic levels
North-Region-County/UTLA/CA-LA-Ward

Separately a tree or similar of spotlights
Access across to related spotlights

Importance of triangulation of multiple sources of data to highlight areas of concern, etc.

Underlying low-level data which will be more on a specific topic, e.g. deprivation, income, access to opportunity, perhaps more on a domain-linked basis.

People can go at it through a theme-level, e.g. income. Links to many income datasets

Multiple levels of exploration

Economic insecurity, perhaps talking about three or so of these domains, then may go across to a different spotlight, perhaps zoom in/out on geography, explore the data that these are derived from.

Rosario: main focus is place. Currently structuring data around JRF's key themes.
Less open than possible as focused around JRF priorities.

Q: is geography the right key tool for filtering?
Q: why do users care about geographies? What are they trying to answer from their policy perspective?
Q: What questions do users have as they navigate around the data?

Spoke to stakeholders across a wide range of organisations
Right granularity? Not easy to know. Users tend to have a question or a challenge in mind. Need data to help them answer the question or support them with the challenge.
ChatGPT influences on how people interact with search engines
Users confident about identifying their challenge, but data not discoverable
Geography: when we present or talk about UK data, Scotland and NI assume it means England and Wales
Important to clearly identify where the data is coming from. If source is UK-wide, making it explicit that it comes from all nations. Otherwise, people will assume that it doesn't.
What is the right granularity? Depends on the question and context.
LA may want to compare LA data to England/UK-wide
User may want to highlight their own data in comparison to others. Larger areas, closest neighbour, closest statistical neighbour, suitable comparisons.
Prototype different visualisations before integrating into site
Visualisations are simple and stand on their own
Zooming in/out and data linkages should be tested with users

Helpful to hear an overview of the project as a whole
Where the organisation is heading next in terms of next stage deliverables

Rosario: people are demanding local information - what does it mean for someone working locally
89% of E&W organisations are grassroot - that's why the emphasis on place is so strong

Millie: when speaking to users, challenges of working with existing data architecture
What questions do a user have which the current data doesn't allow them to answer?
e.g. gov.uk not standardised so hard to integrate different datasets
Some users will want data to see an insight, others will want the raw data
Different types of user, more bespoke users who get their own route through the site
Role of community, need to create a stronger data community in this space
Would be useful to know what kind of level of maturity there is in the space

Dave: trying to steward community resolution and stewardship, governance

Spotlights become the manifestation of one or more questions from the userbase

Rosario: thinking about how users access potentially complex information
Focus on infographics - simply tell story
Making sure comparisons happen between different/neighbouring areas
High level idea of question bank - how users can say "I would like to ask ..."
Key part of open-source components of the site, FAQs etc

Desi: have a place for people to pose questions - we knwo what we need to add
Signals to the community that there are people who can ask/answer specific questions

Millie: something around different levels of zoom
Interested in the assumption that users want a separate Northern site
