    "_To be and to feel economically secure is to live with dignity, 
    to be able to seize opportunities and to have a sense of hope 
    for the future. That requires sufficient and predictable resources, 
    of income and wealth, in relation to the costs and burdens of life.
     But it also rests on secure work and a secure home, on education, 
     on good health, and on support and time for caring. It is sustained 
     by relationships of family, friends and community._" — Graeme Cooke,
     Director of Insight and Policy, JRF.

    "_Housing provides the base from which people live their lives,
    connecting them to work, education, services and their communities. 
    The affordability of housing, alongside the stability, quality and 
    size of homes, is crucial in itself, but also, if unaffordable, 
    can drag occupants into poverty... At worst, households facing unaffordable 
    housing costs can experience destitution, 
    homelessness or rough sleeping._" — JRF poverty report 2023.

    bring additional living costs associated with long-term illness and disability that
    must somehow be met. In turn, this can lead to living in deprivation, low income
    and poverty._" — JRF poverty report 2023.
