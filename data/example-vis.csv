Symbol,Description
"I","Figures are for the United Kingdom from 2002/03 onwards. Earlier years are for Great Britain only. The reference period is single financial years. Source: Family Resources Survey (FRS), Department for Work and Pensions."
"II","Figures derived are unrounded. Before use of these figures, users must use the following rounding conventions: a) Percentages must be rounded to the nearest whole per cent. b) Numbers must be rounded to the nearest 0.1 million (or 100,000 individuals). c) Amounts must be rounded to the nearest £1 (weekly) and nearest £100 (annual). These rounding conventions have been set to reflect that HBAI estimates are based on survey data and not actual records of individuals in the UK."
"III","The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors that control for tenure type, Council Tax Band and a number of demographic variables. The grossing factors are based on 2011 Census data, so caution should be exercised when making comparisons with published reports and tables prior to 2012/13. Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining non-sampling bias."
"IV","Incomes are adjusted through a process of equivalisation to allow for fair comparison across different household sizes and compositions. Small changes in estimates from year to year, particularly at the bottom of the income distribution, may not be significant in view of data uncertainties. Please read the Meta Information page for more information - click on the 'i' next to the breakdown label."
"V",""".."" indicates data not being available in that year."
"VI","It is recommended that any estimates for groups of less than 50,000 individuals are not used as sample sizes are too small for robust analysis."

"3ya","Estimates based on location in the United Kingdom and ethnicity must be calculated as three year averages. All rolling three-year averages calculated and published for any period including 2020/21 are based on the remaining two available data points only.

"covid2122","(a) Data collection during the financial year 2021/22 was via telephone interviewing as opposed to the established face to face method used prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While the achieved FRS 2021/22 sample was larger and more representative than in 2020/21, there remains some residual bias in the FRS sample resulting from change in mode and therefore 2021/22 estimates and changes should be interpreted in this context. (b) For the 2021/22 data, all estimates of material deprivation, including when combined with low income measures, are not strictly comparable with previous years. Several of the questions asked as part of the material deprivation measure were affected by government restrictions introduced in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Although the impact on survey responses was less marked than last year, restrictions remained in place throughout the first quarter of the survey year and the effect the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had on social interactions continued to unwind during the remainder of the survey year as restrictions were removed and society began returning to normal. Changes in recorded material deprivation for 2021/22 may not fully reflect the real change in household circumstances compared to 2020/21 or the pre-pandemic period. (c) For the 2021/22 estimates, wages are treated as income from employment rather than state support, irrespective of any support payments from Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) that the respondent's employer was receiving in respect of their employment. Amounts received through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) for the self-employed are indirectly included as part of the reporting of profit data for the most recent available tax year.

"div","From 2021/22, income received from director’s dividends is included in the estimates for the first time following an addition to the Family Resources Survey. The income is treated as income from earnings in this dataset."
"covid2021","Data relating to 2020/21 is not available via Stat Xplore due to data quality concerns affecting many of the HBAI estimates calculated below UK (headline) level for that year. Further details can be found in the technical report which accompanied the release of the 2020/21 statistics. This report details the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the size and composition of the FRS sample. A link is available in the Meta Information page - click on the 'i' next to Financial Year label."
"r","In the 2019/20 statistics a minor methodological revision was made to capture all income from child maintenance. As a result, the full back series (back to 1994/95) was revised. Gov.uk publication files issued prior to 2019/20 may contain slightly different figures. Please refer to the HBAI Quality and Methodology Information Report for more information."
