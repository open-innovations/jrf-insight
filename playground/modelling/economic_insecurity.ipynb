    "### `The concept`\n",
    "Different statistics are normalised in the range 0-1 and then mean averaged. A score of 0 corresponds to something less likely to cause poverty (e.g. extremely low rate  of unemployment).\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest and lowest values will score 1 and 0, respectively, and everything else will fall somewhere in between. We do this across 6 metrics for economic insecurity and their average score is taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics are: economic inactivity, unemployment, mean weekly wage, median weekly wage, claimants as a proportion of residents aged 16-64 and proportion of households that are fuel poor. In the interest of simplicity, each metric has equal weighting. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `Assumptions/Disclaimers`\n",
    "Where data is unavailable, the default is to use the value for the parent (containing) geography. For example, if Leeds had missing data then the value for Yorkshire & the Humber would be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the final average is calculated, if the data is for a given statistic is unavailable, that statistic does not contribute to the index score. We drop rows that have fewer than 3 values. This is to avoid places getting an index score with too few data points contributing to the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it shouldn't be the case that geographies at the same level could have different statistics contributing to the index score. The output csv file contains a list of the metrics that were per place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this is a proof of concept. The aim of this model is not to create a new measure of poverty, but to see how different places rank relative to eachother across a range of different metrics. We are testing out new ways of combining different datasets to provide useful insights. The results of this model should not be seen as a measure of poverty or taken at absolute face value."

    "- Easy to add weights in if necessary. \n",
